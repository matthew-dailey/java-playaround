## playaround

[![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/matthew-dailey/java-playaround.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthew-dailey/playaround)

This project lets me play around with some code to do random things in Java.

For example, testing out:
* Lambda functions in Java 8
* Concurrency in Java 8, along with Guava Futures
* A solution to filter out records from a set if already present in Accumulo
